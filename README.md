# mMagic Minecraft Mod

## Basis of this mod

The idea behind this mod is to incorporate a balanced Minecraft 
Magic experience that builds upon the existing vanilla one.

Using vanilla materials you can achieve magical greatness!
However, be wary of the consequences if things go awry...

## How to do x...
Grimoire: A magical collection of spells and incantations, it is required to both fuel your magic and direct it into something useful.

Scepter: Almost useless on its own, but a fantastic conductor of mana. Use with a Grimoire in your off hand or beware the result...
Each Scepter usage will use one Mana stored in the Grimoire. In order to recharge you must make and hold a Soul Crystal in your main hand then sneak and use the crystal.
 
Soul Crystals can currently be charged by using them on a Mana Crucible that is sitting on a Magma block. Soul crystal shards can either be smelted from Soul Sand, or mined from Mana Crystal formations in the overworld.
