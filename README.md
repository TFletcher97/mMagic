# mMagic Minecraft Mod

## Basis of this mod

The idea behind this mod is to incorporate a balanced Minecraft 
Magic experience that builds upon the existing vanilla one.

Using vanilla materials you can achieve magical greatness!
However, be wary of the consequences if things go awry...

##How to do x...
Craft a Wand and a Magic Book, hold the book in your offhand
and use the wand in your other!

Each usage will use one Mana stored in the book. In order to recharge
you must make and hold a Soul Crystal in your main hand whilst holding
the book in your offhand, then sneak and use the crystal.
